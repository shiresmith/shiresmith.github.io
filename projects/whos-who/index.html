			<div class="synopsis">
				<p class="firstLine">Remembering someone's name is one of the simplest, yet most powerful, ways of making a great impression.</p>
				
				<p>It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name 
					activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people's names, and even
					to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel 
					better when people remember us, and worse when they don't.  When you forget someone's name, they feel that they (and their 
					business!) are not important to you.
				</p>
					
				<p>It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  
					In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone's name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart.
					We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill 
					worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Here are a few techniques that will dramatically increase your name recall:
				</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li><h3>Repeat, Repeat, Repeat</h3>
						<p>Make it a point to repeat the new name during the conversation. "Hi, Mark, nice to meet you," or
							"How long have you been with Acme, Mark?"   Don't overdo it, in a cheesy caricature of a salesman kind of way.
							Repetition is your most powerful tool, but people will be suspicious if you appear overly fond of their name.
							At the end of your conversation if you realize you have forgotten their name, don't be embarassed to ask for
							it again.  Start with a compliment like "I've had so much fun talking with you, and I've completely forgotten your name."			
						</p>
						 <p>
							The <span class="appname">Whos Who</span> app has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon
							where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied 
							many times over a short period.  Balota et al (2007).  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely
							to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification 
							with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.
						 </p>
					</li>
					
					<li><h3>Spell it Out</h3>
						<p>We are visual creatures, and asking someone to spell their name helps create a mental picture of the name.  
							When we are struggling to remember a name, we often remember that it started with an "M."
							It is also helpful to ask for a business card to strengthen the visual connection with the name.   Better still,
							if the card contains a social media link that you have an account with, mention that you will add their 
							connection there as well.  This can casually deepen and reinforce a name.
						</p>
						<p>If you are in a situation where the name you are trying to remember is in your contacts or LinkedIn,
							<span class="appname">Whos Who</span> can import the photo and data for you. You can also add photos from your camera roll.
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><h3>Make a Story</h3>
						<p>Personal details such as hobbies or children's names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like
							stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it.
							It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but it helps
							fill in the story that aids in memory recall.
						</p>
						<p>
							The <span class="appname">Whos Who</span> app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those
							very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the
							lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.  
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><h3>Associations and Triggers</h3>
						<p>Mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations are often used by memory experts. Think "Joe from Jersey,"
						"Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy 
						wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple.	
						</p>
						<p>If you are so inclined, <span class="appname">Whos Who</span> has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations.
						The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has
						shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.  
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><h3>Connections</h3>
					<p>Whenever possible, it is useful to make a connection between your new acquaintance, and someone you know with the same name.  
					 Bob, who is tall like Uncle Bob.  John, who resembles Johnny Depp.  	
					</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><h3>Choose to Care</h3>
					<p>The primary reason we have problem remembering names is that we're not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of
					information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision 
					consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much 
					better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don't.		
					</p>
					</li>
					
				</ul>

				<p>A person's name is the single most important word to them.  </p>
				
Few situations will make you cringe more than standing next to someone you’ve met several times and drawing a blank on his or her name.


Plus, let’s face it, blanking on someone’s name whom you’ve met before — or worse, just been introduced to — is borderline rude, and fully embarrassing.
