			<h1>Bruce's Bio</h1>
			<div class="synopsis">
				<img src="./images/Author.png" >
				<p>Bruce was born and raised in the outskirts of Boston, Mass, moving to South Florida in his early teens.  He still resides there with his wife of 34 years, and his two lovable Malamutes.</p>
				<p>Shortly after starting his first novel, 'The Alien's Gift,' Bruce took vacation to write because the characters in his head insisted on having their story told.  Today he is retired and is fortunate to have the time to write whenever the muse strikes.</p>  
				<p>A long-time lover of sci-fi and science, Bruce also enjoys staying informed of the latest discoveries in the sciences, especially the mind-blowing world of theoretical physics.  Bruce believes that in order to write good sci-fi, you must be grounded in good science.</p>

				<p class="firstLine">Paranormal Investigations normally involve ghosts or poltergeists.</p>
				<p>
				Sometimes they involve homes that take possession of one of the occupants.  They can be messy affairs 
				with knives flashing or shotguns blasting.  The end results, dead bodies and a vacant house.
				</p><p>
				Destiny is unique in that no one would ever notice.
				</p><p>
				It could never be documented.  Admittedly, the likelihood of such a scenario is too far-fetched to conceive.
				</p><p>
				Still.. given the opportunity, would you purchase a mansion being sold for a fraction of its value, 
				and being an old home, wouldn’t you tend to dismiss strange sounds?
				</p><p>
				Take comfort in knowing that Destiny is only a creation of this author’s mind.  Besides, who would 
				be gullible enough to be drawn into such a web?  Wait, did you answer yes to any of those questions?  
				Well then just maybe Destiny is the home for you.
				</p><p>
				If so, you are invited to the dance.

				</div>

				<p>Marc's morning starts off like any other. Up at 5 a.m., he sits on the patio of his country home, sipping coffee and watching his dogs frolic. But then he feels overcome by an unusual sensation, one that encompasses his entire body and produces unknown thoughts and emotions-something not of this world.</p>
				<p>As the days progress, it becomes more and more apparent that an alien life form is using Marc's mind. With the help of his friends, Marc tries to understand exactly how to combat this force, and they catch a break when they are contacted by the alien's caretakers. Gera, as the alien is known, is attempting to escape his medically-induced prison sentence and is using Marc as his vessel.</p>
				<p>But Gera isn't all that he seems - and in a surprising twist, Marc's contact with Gera gives him a special power to "jump" into other people's minds. Marc uses this gift to right the wrongs in society, never realizing that an epic intergalactic battle is about to take place, one that might very well signal the end of Planet Earth-and of Marc.</p>
